It also refers to particular physiological processes or states that occur after exercise and are not related to either the active or resting states which is managed by genetic variation in key genes currently known to be involved in the management of exercise recovery. The predictive genetic analysis of exercise recovery is based on 5 SNP markers in 5 key genes which are; COL1A1 gene (***Collagen, Type I, Alpha 1;1 SNP) is located on chr 17, encodes for the collagen a-chains where these collagens are the major structural proteins of tendons, ligaments and other components of musculoskeletal tissues. The polymorphism in this gene is associated with tendon/ligament injury prevalence resulting in serious musculoskeletal disorders, lack of biological redundancy exists within the collagen fibril which is associated with less severe exercise-related traits. CRP gene (**C-Reactive Protein;1 SNP) is located on chr 1, encodes for a protein that belongs to the pentraxin family, involved in several host defense related functions based on its ability to recognize damaged cells and to initiate their elimination in the blood. The level of this protein in plasma increases greatly during acute phase response to tissue injury, infection, or other inflammatory stimuli. The polymorphism in this gene can lead to alteration in C-reactive protein release at both rest and during exercise. IL-6 gene (***Interleukin-6;1 SNP) is located on chr 7, encodes a cytokine that plays a role in inflammation and maturation of B cells. It is primarily produced at sites of acute and chronic inflammation, where it is secreted into the serum and induces a transcriptional inflammatory response through the interleukin-6 receptor, alpha. The polymorphism in this gene modulates the IL6 levels and influences the creatine kinase levels, which is associated with unexplained underperformance syndrome (UPS) and prolonged recovery periods. IL6R gene ( ***Interleukin 6 Receptor;1 SNP) is located on chr 1, encodes a subunit of the interleukin 6 (IL6) receptor complex, is a potent pleiotropic cytokine that regulates cell growth and differentiation which plays an important role in the immune response. The polymorphism in this gene is associated with higher sIL-6R levels and circulating/ plasma IL-6 levels leading to longer recovery periods after exercise. SOD2 gene ( ***Superoxide Dismutase 2;1 SNP) is located on chr 6, encodes a mitochondrial protein that binds to the superoxide by-products of oxidative phosphorylation and converts them to hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen. A polymorphism is associated with reduced enzyme activity which leads to a compromised ROS scavenging system in the cell resulting in the state of oxidative stress thereby increasing the exogenous antioxidant requirement for the body. It is also associated with increased creatine kinase post exercise causing longer recovery period post exercise.

The predictive genetic analysis of muscle power is based on 7 SNP markers in 6 key genes which are; ACE gene (***Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme;1 SNP) is located on chr 17, encodes for angiotensin-converting enzymes. It is involved in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte balance. Polymorphism in this gene leads to reduced levels of the ACE enzyme, which may mean poor performance in sprinting/power training. ACTN3 gene (***Actinin Alpha 3;1 SNP) is located on chr 11, encodes a protein called alpha-actinin-3 that is expressed only in type-II muscle fibers and is responsible for generating force at high velocity. The protein is associated with greater baseline strength, protection against muscle damage and a higher proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers. The polymorphism in this gene results in a complete lack of expression of a-actinin-3 and are more likely to perform poorly in power-based activities. AGT gene (***Angiotensinogen;1 SNP) is located on chr 1, encodes a protein called angiotensinogen that is a part of the renin-angiotensin system, regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. It is a precursor to the angiotensin II protein that acts as a skeletal muscle growth factor. The polymorphism in this gene is associated with increased angiotensin II levels and an improved power/strength-based performance. IL-6 gene (**Interleukin 6;1 SNP) is located on chr 7, encodes a cytokine that plays a role in inflammation and maturation of B cells. It is primarily produced at sites of acute and chronic inflammation, where it is secreted into the serum and induces a transcriptional inflammatory response through the interleukin-6 receptor, alpha. The polymorphism in this gene modulates the IL6 levels and influences the creatine kinase levels, is associated with under performance syndrome (UPS) and affects performance in power-based activities. PPARA gene (***Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Alpha;1 SNP) is located on chr 22, encodes the subtype PPAR-alpha which is a nuclear transcription factor. The action of peroxisome proliferators is thought to be mediated via specific receptors PPARs, which belong to the steroid hormone receptor superfamily that affect the expression of target genes involved in cell proliferation, cell differentiation and in immune and inflammation responses. Three closely related subtypes (alpha, beta/delta, and gamma) have been identified. The heritability of muscle strength has been shown to be polygenic in nature with strength and power-related phenotypes. VDR gene (***Vitamin D Receptor;2 SNP) is located on chr 12, encodes vitamin D3 receptor that is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible transcription factors which is associated with physical fitness, performance and muscular efficiency. Polymorphism in this gene reduces the levels of muscular strength in power based activities.

It plays a pivotal role in the regulation of the cardiac, pulmonary, vascular, endocrine and central nervous system with response to exercise. With exercise, minute ventilation (VE) increases in response to the elevated demand for oxygen through augmentation of both tidal volume and respiratory rate. The polymorphism in this gene is associated with cardiopulmonary response to exercise with a reduced VO2 capacity. CRP gene (***C-Reactive Protein;1 SNP) is located on chr 6, encodes for a protein that belongs to the pentraxin family which includes serum amyloid P component protein and pentraxin 3. Pentraxins are involved in complement activation and amplification. CRP levels are inversely associated with VO2 max. It is involved in several host defense related functions based on its ability to recognize damaged cells and to initiate their elimination in the blood. The polymorphism in this gene can lead to alteration in CRP release at both rest and during exercise. PPARGC1A gene (***Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor y Coactivator la;1 SNP) is located on chr 1, encodes for PGC-1a, the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. This protein is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism.

    "Definition": "Calcium, the most abundant mineral in the body, and it is vital for bone health. Heart, muscles and nerves also need calcium to function properly which is managed by genetic variation in a key gene currently known to be involved in the management of calcium level. The predictive genetic analysis of calcium level is based on 4 SNP markers in 2 key genes which is; CASR gene (***Calcium Sensing Receptor;3 SNP) is located on chr 3, encodes a calcium sensing receptor that plays a key role in maintaining calcium homeostasis. It inhibits the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), stimulates calcitonin release from the thyroid and urinary calcium excretion. The polymorphism in this gene results in reduced CASR activity, altered signal transduction, intracellular trafficking, cell-surface expression and lower calcium levels which is associated with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia. VDR gene (***Vitamin D receptor;1 SNP) is located on chr 12, provides instructions for making a vitamin D receptor protein that allows to maintain the balance of calcium and phosphate in the body which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. It also plays a role to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Polymorphism in this gene leads to dysfunctioning of 1, 25(OH)2D3 that causes rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. These markers are potential indicators for likelihood & predisposition to calcium level based on genotype & lifestyle.",

    "Definition": "Vitamin B9 is the natural form of folate, a water-soluble vitamin that helps to form DNA and RNA which is involved in protein metabolism. It plays a key role in breaking down homocysteine, an amino acid, to produce healthy red blood cells and is critical during periods of rapid growth, such as during pregnancy and fetal development which is managed by genetic variation in key genes currently known to be involved in the management of vitamin B9 level. The predictive genetic analysis of vitamin B9 is based on 4 SNP markers in 3 key genes which are; MTHFD1 gene (***Methylenetetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase, Cyclohydrolase And Formyltetrahydrofolate Synthetase 1;1 SNP) is located on chr 14, encodes a protein that possesses three distinct enzymatic activities, 5,10methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase and 10formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase. Each of these activities catalyzes one of three sequential reactions in the interconversion of 1-carbon derivatives of tetrahydrofolate, which are substrates for methionine, thymidylate, and de novo purine synthesis. The polymorphism in this gene is associated with developmental issues associated with improper maternal folate intake. MTHFR gene (**Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase;2 SNP) is located on chr 1, is required for a chemical reaction in which the vitamin folate plays a role (also called vitamin B9). This enzyme transforms a folate form known as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to another folate form known as 5- methyltetrahydrofolate. This is the most common form of folate found in the blood, and it is required for the multistep process that converts homocysteine to methionine. MTRR gene (***5-Methyltetrahydrofolate-Homocysteine Methyltransferase Reductase;1 SNP) is located on chr 5, is essential for folate (B9) metabolism, encodes a member of the ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase (FNR) family of electron transferases. Polymorphism in this gene is associated with accumulation of homocysteine and leads to reduced activity methionine synthase Therefore an optimized vitamin B9 intake is preferred. This protein functions in the synthesis of methionine by regenerating methionine synthase to a functional state. Because methionine synthesis requires methyl-group transfer by a folate donor, activity of the encoded enzyme is important for vitamin B9 metabolism and cellular methylation. Mutations in this gene can cause homocystinuria-megaloblastic anemia, cbl E type. These markers are potential indicators for likelihood & predisposition to vitamin B9 level based on genotype & lifestyle.",

At present, predictive genetic analysis is based on 3 SNP markers in 3 deterministic genes which are; ACADS gene (***Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Short Chain;1 SNP) is located in chr 12, provides instructions for making an enzyme, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD). This enzyme plays an important role in energy metabolism especially during a physiological response to tissue energy depletion during periods of fasting, illnesses, and increased muscular activity. Mutations in this gene are associated with deficiency of the SCAD which is marked by an increased amount of fatty acids, and the presence of increased butyrylcarnitine (C4) in blood plasma, increased ethylmalonic acid (EMA) concentrations in urine and higher levels of HDL-C which may lead to cardiovascular diseases. CETP gene (***Cholesterol Ester Transfer Protein;1 SNP) is located on chr 16, encodes for cholesteryl ester transfer protein, which transfers cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein B-containing particles in exchange for triglyceride. The polymorphism in this gene leads to lower CETP levels, promoting reduced concentration of HDL formation and increased HDL levels are associated with severe atherosclerosis. PPARD gene (***Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Delta;1 SNP) gene located on chr 6 encodes a protein that belongs to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family, which functions as an integrator of transcriptional repression and nuclear receptor signaling which plays a key role in blood lipid metabolism.

Any variations in ADIPOQ gene may lead to higher levels of adiponectin in blood, which makes weight loss easier. IL-6 gene (***Interleukin 6;1 SNP) is located on chr 7, encodes a cytokine that functions in inflammation and the maturation of B cells which implicates the control of weight, appetite and energy metabolism that affects glucose and lipid metabolism through various mechanisms including decreased glucose uptake into adipocytes, decreased glycogen synthesis in the liver and increased lipolysis, resulting in obesity and insulin resistance.

It is among the first common variants that have been associated with the regulation of body mass index. The significant role is in the regulation of energy balance, possibly by controlling the intake of specific macronutrients and the regulation of energy expenditure. TMEM18 (***Transmembrane Protein; 1SNP) is located on chr 2, is a protein coding gene involved in regulating appetite, body weight, and energy expenditure. It is the strongest candidate for childhood obesity identified from GWASs and is downregulated in children with obesity.

These natural processes respond primarily to light and dark that affect most living things which is based on genetic variation in the gene currently known to be involved in the \"sleep-wake cycle\" which is instigated by genetic variation in a causative risk gene. At present, predictive genetic analysis is based on 1 SNP marker in 1 gene which is; CLOCK gene (***Clock Circadian Regulator; 1 SNP) located on chr 4 encodes for a protein that plays a central role in the regulation of circadian rhythms which regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. Thus providing an efficient mechanism for the circadian control of gene expression which could regulate at the cellular level, circadian responses to various external stimuli. This marker is a potential indicator for likelihood & predisposition to circadian rhythm based on genotype & lifestyle.",
